\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Orchestrates the command-\/line database execution. 

The {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine}} class is the central controller responsible for managing user input and output, and dispatching commands It sets up the shared {\ttfamily \doxylink{struct_command_context}{Command\+Context}} which provides access to the most important applicaton data and I/O handlers for all commands. Commands are registered during initialization and executed based on user input.

Constructs the \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine}, initializes shared resources, and registers supported commands. 

Constructs the {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine}} and initializes its core components.

This constructor sets up the {\ttfamily \doxylink{struct_command_context}{Command\+Context}} which contains the {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_catalog}{Catalog}} and all necessary I/O handlers. It then uses {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_file_command_factory}{File\+Command\+Factory}} and {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_catalog_command_factory}{Catalog\+Command\+Factory}} to create and register all recognized commands.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em output\+Console\+Writter} & A reference to the console output handler. \\
\hline
{\em input\+Console\+Reader} & A reference to the console input handler. \\
\hline
{\em output\+File\+Writter} & A reference to the file output handler for saving data. \\
\hline
{\em input\+File\+Reader} & A reference to the file input handler for loading data.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
This constructor takes references to necessary I/O and file handling utilities, along with the {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_catalog}{Catalog}} itself, to construct the {\ttfamily \doxylink{struct_command_context}{Command\+Context}}. It then populates the {\ttfamily commands} map using {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_file_command_factory}{File\+Command\+Factory}} and {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_catalog_command_factory}{Catalog\+Command\+Factory}} to create all supported {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_command}{Command}} objects. Any errors during command creation (e.\+g., if a factory fails to produce a command) are caught and printed to the console, but the engine initialization will still attempt to complete for other commands.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em output\+Console\+Writter} & A reference to the console output writer. \\
\hline
{\em input\+Console\+Reader} & A reference to the console input reader. \\
\hline
{\em output\+File\+Writter} & A reference to the file output writer. \\
\hline
{\em input\+File\+Reader} & A reference to the file input reader. \\

Copy constructor for the \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine} class. 

Performs a deep copy of the {\ttfamily other} \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine} object.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em other} & The \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine} object to be copied.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
Performs a deep copy of the {\ttfamily other} \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine} object.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item It first copies the {\ttfamily loaded\+Catalog} from {\ttfamily other.\+loaded\+Catalog}.
\item Then, it initializes the {\ttfamily context} of the new \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine} instance. The new {\ttfamily context} is bound to {\itshape this} object\textquotesingle{}s newly copied {\ttfamily loaded\+Catalog}, while maintaining references to the same external I/O utilities (console, file readers/writers) as the source {\ttfamily other} \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine}.
\item Finally, it iterates through {\ttfamily other.\+commands} and performs a deep copy of each {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_command}{Command}} object using its {\ttfamily clone()} method. Each cloned command is then associated with the {\ttfamily context} of the {\itshape newly constructed} \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine}.

Destructor. 

Destroys the {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine}} instance.

Calls {\ttfamily clear\+Memory()} to clean up dynamically allocated {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_command}{Command}} objects stored in the {\ttfamily commands} map, preventing memory leaks when an \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine} object is destroyed.

This destructor calls the {\ttfamily clear\+Memory()} helper method to release all dynamically allocated {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_command}{Command}} objects managed by this \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine} instance, preventing memory leaks. \Hypertarget{class_engine_a3b08e64acacd073a4e433d7e4daf1c50}\index{Engine@{Engine}!Engine@{Engine}}

Move constructor for the \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine} class. 

Constructs a new \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine} object by efficiently transferring resources from a temporary or expiring {\ttfamily other} \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine} object.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em other} & The \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine} object to be moved from.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
Constructs a new \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine} object by efficiently transferring resources (the {\ttfamily loaded\+Catalog} and ownership of {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_command}{Command}} objects) from a temporary or expiring {\ttfamily other} \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine} object. This avoids expensive deep copies.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The {\ttfamily loaded\+Catalog} is moved from {\ttfamily other.\+loaded\+Catalog}.
\item The {\ttfamily context} is initialized, binding to the {\itshape newly moved} {\ttfamily loaded\+Catalog} of {\itshape this} \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine} object. The references to external I/O utilities remain the same.
\item Ownership of the {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_command}{Command}} objects is transferred from {\ttfamily other.\+commands} to {\ttfamily this-\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}commands} using {\ttfamily std\+::move} on the map. This leaves {\ttfamily other.\+commands} empty.

Copy assignment operator for the \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine} class. 

Enables deep copying of one \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine} object\textquotesingle{}s state to another. It first cleans up any dynamically allocated {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_command}{Command}} objects currently held by the left-\/hand side object, then performs a deep copy of the {\ttfamily loaded\+Catalog} and all {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_command}{Command}} objects from the {\ttfamily other} (right-\/hand side) \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine}. Self-\/assignment is handled to prevent self-\/destruction.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em other} & The \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine} object from which to copy. \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
A reference to the current \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine} object ({\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}this}) after the copy.
\end{DoxyReturn}
Enables deep copying of one \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine} object\textquotesingle{}s state to another.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item It first checks for self-\/assignment ({\ttfamily this == \&other}) to prevent unnecessary operations and potential self-\/destruction.
\item All dynamically allocated {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_command}{Command}} objects currently owned by the left-\/hand side object ({\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}this}) are {\ttfamily delete}d, and the {\ttfamily commands} map is cleared.
\item The {\ttfamily loaded\+Catalog} is copied from the {\ttfamily other} \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine}.
\item The {\ttfamily \doxylink{struct_command_context}{Command\+Context}} needs to be effectively "{}re-\/bound"{} or re-\/initialized to point to the newly copied {\ttfamily loaded\+Catalog} of {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}this} object, while retaining its references to the external I/O utilities. Note that direct re-\/assignment of a reference member is not possible. The current implementation implicitly assumes {\ttfamily context} can handle the {\ttfamily loaded\+Catalog} changing.
\item New, independent {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_command}{Command}} objects are created by calling {\ttfamily clone()} on each command from the {\ttfamily other} \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine}.

Move assignment operator for the \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine} class. 

Transfers resources from a temporary or expiring {\ttfamily other} \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine} object to the current \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine} object. Self-\/assignment is handled. The {\ttfamily other} object is left in a valid, but unspecified, state suitable for destruction.

\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
A reference to the current \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine} object ({\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}this}) after the move.
\end{DoxyReturn}
Transfers resources from a temporary or expiring {\ttfamily other} \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine} object to the current \doxylink{class_engine}{Engine} object. This operation frees any resources currently held by {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}this}, then efficiently moves the {\ttfamily loaded\+Catalog} and ownership of {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_command}{Command}} objects from {\ttfamily other}. Self-\/assignment is handled.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Prevents erroneous operations if {\ttfamily this} and {\ttfamily other} are the same object.
\item Calls {\ttfamily clear\+Memory()} to release existing {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_command}{Command}} objects owned by {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}this}.
\item {\ttfamily loaded\+Catalog} is moved from {\ttfamily other.\+loaded\+Catalog}. Ownership of {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_command}{Command}} objects (their raw pointers) is moved from {\ttfamily other.\+commands} to {\ttfamily this-\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}commands}.
\item The {\ttfamily context} member is a value holding references. After {\ttfamily loaded\+Catalog = std\+::move(other.\+loaded\+Catalog)}, the {\ttfamily context} of {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}this} implicitly operates on its now-\/updated {\ttfamily loaded\+Catalog}. The references to external I/O objects remain unchanged.

Starts the main application loop, continuously processing user commands. 

This method displays a welcome message and then enters a loop to\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Prompt the user for input.
\item Parse the raw input into command arguments.
\item Dispatch the command.
\item Continues until the "{}exit"{} command is entered, at which point the loop terminates.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

It begins by displaying a friendly welcome message and instructions. It then enters an infinite loop\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item It prompts the user for input ({\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}) and reads an entire line.
\item The raw input is then parsed into a vector of arguments using {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_command_parser_ac55ccf87ff1dac5137f96084cece631a}{Command\+Parser\+::parse\+Raw\+Command}}, which handles spaces and quoted strings.
\item The parsed arguments are passed to {\ttfamily dispatch\+Command} for execution.
\item The loop continues until the user explicitly enters the "{}exit"{} command. Upon receiving "{}exit"{}, a goodbye message is printed, and the loop breaks, terminating the application.
