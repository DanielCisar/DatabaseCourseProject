\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
A factory class responsible for creating instances of file-\/related commands. 

This static factory provides a centralized mechanism to instantiate concrete {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_command}{Command}} objects that handle file system operations (like opening, saving, and closing files). It decouples the command creation logic from the client code.

Creates and returns a new {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_command}{Command}} object based on the provided name for file operations. 

This static method acts as a factory for commands that interact with files. It maps a command name string to a specific {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_command}{Command}} implementation and constructs an instance of that command, passing it the shared {\ttfamily \doxylink{struct_command_context}{Command\+Context}}.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em name} & The string identifier of the file command to create (e.\+g., "{}open"{}, "{}save"{}, "{}exit"{}). \\
\hline
{\em context} & A reference to the {\ttfamily \doxylink{struct_command_context}{Command\+Context}} to be used by the created command. \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
A pointer to a newly allocated {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_command}{Command}} object. 
\end{DoxyReturn}

\begin{DoxyExceptions}{Exceptions}
{\em std\+::runtime\+\_\+error} & If the provided {\ttfamily name} does not correspond to a known file command.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyExceptions}
This static method implements the factory logic for file-\/related commands. It checks the {\ttfamily name} against a list of recognized commands and returns a dynamically allocated instance of the corresponding command class.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em name} & The string identifier of the command to create. \\
\hline
{\em context} & A reference to the {\ttfamily \doxylink{struct_command_context}{Command\+Context}} to be used by the created command. \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
A pointer to a newly allocated {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_command}{Command}} object. The caller assumes ownership. 
\end{DoxyReturn}

\begin{DoxyExceptions}{Exceptions}
{\em std\+::runtime\+\_\+error} & If the provided {\ttfamily name} does not match any of the supported file commands. \\
\hline
\end{DoxyExceptions}
