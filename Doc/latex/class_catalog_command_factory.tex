\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
A factory class responsible for creating instances of catalog-\/related commands. 

This static factory provides a centralized mechanism to instantiate concrete {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_command}{Command}} objects based on a given command name string. It decouples the command creation logic from the client code.

Creates and returns a new {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_command}{Command}} object based on the provided name. 

This static method acts as a factory for all commands that operate on the database catalog. It maps a command name string to a specific {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_command}{Command}} implementation and constructs an instance of that command.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em name} & The string identifier of the command to create (e.\+g., "{}insert"{}, "{}select"{}, "{}describe"{}). \\
\hline
{\em context} & A reference to the {\ttfamily \doxylink{struct_command_context}{Command\+Context}} to be used by the created command. \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
A pointer to a newly allocated {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_command}{Command}} object. 
\end{DoxyReturn}

\begin{DoxyExceptions}{Exceptions}
{\em std\+::runtime\+\_\+error} & If the provided {\ttfamily name} does not correspond to a known catalog command.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyExceptions}
This static method implements the factory logic. It checks the {\ttfamily name} against a list of recognized catalog command names and returns a dynamically allocated instance of the corresponding command class. The created command is initialized with the provided {\ttfamily context}.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em name} & The string identifier of the command to create. \\
\hline
{\em context} & A reference to the {\ttfamily \doxylink{struct_command_context}{Command\+Context}} to be used by the created command. \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
A pointer to a newly allocated {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_command}{Command}} object. The caller assumes ownership. 
\end{DoxyReturn}

\begin{DoxyExceptions}{Exceptions}
{\em std\+::runtime\+\_\+error} & If the provided {\ttfamily name} does not match any of the supported catalog commands. \\
\hline
\end{DoxyExceptions}
